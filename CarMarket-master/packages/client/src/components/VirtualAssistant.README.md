- **Smooth Animations**: Professional transitions and micro-interactions
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **Keyboard Support**: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatic scrolling to latest messages
- **Minimize/Maximize**: User can minimize chat while keeping it open

### 4. Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus on input when opened
- **High Contrast**: Clear, readable interface
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper HTML structure

## Usage

### Basic Integration

The assistant is already integrated into the Layout component and wrapped with necessary providers in App.tsx:

```tsx
// App.tsx
<AssistantProvider>
  <Router>
    {/* Your routes */}
  </Router>
</AssistantProvider>

// Layout.tsx
<VirtualAssistant />
```

### Programmatic Control

You can control the assistant from any component:

```tsx
import { useAssistant } from "../contexts/AssistantContext";

function MyComponent() {
  const { sendMessage, toggleAssistant } = useAssistant();

  const handleHelp = () => {
    toggleAssistant();
    sendMessage("How do I search for cars?");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleHelp}>Get Help</button>;
}
```

## Customization

### Adding New Intents

To add new intents, update `assistant.service.ts`:

```typescript
// Add new handler method
private handleNewIntent(query: string): AssistantResponse {
  return {
    message: "Your response here",
    suggestions: [...],
    actions: [...]
  };
}

// Add to processQuery method
if (this.matchesIntent(lowerQuery, ["keyword1", "keyword2"])) {
  return this.handleNewIntent(lowerQuery);
}
```

### Styling

The assistant uses Tailwind CSS. Customize colors in `VirtualAssistant.tsx`:

```tsx
// Change primary color from blue to your brand color
className="bg-blue-600" → className="bg-your-color-600"
```

### Welcome Message

Modify the greeting in `assistant.service.ts`:

```typescript
getWelcomeMessage(): AssistantResponse {
  // Customize greeting logic here
}
```

- Lazy loading of messages
- Optimized animations

### 4. **User Experience**
- Typing indicator for feedback
- Action buttons for quick navigation
- Contextual suggestions
- Time stamps on messages
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Clean, readable code
- Comprehensive comments
- Modular architecture
- Easy to extend

### 6. **Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 compliant
- Screen reader friendly
- Keyboard navigable
- Focus management

## Advanced Features

### Action Buttons
Messages can include action buttons for quick navigation:

```typescript
{
  message: "Your message",
  actions: [
    { label: "View Profile", action: "navigate", data: "/profile" },
    { label: "Search Cars", action: "navigate", data: "/" }
  ]
}
```

### Suggestion Chips
Quick suggestions help users ask common questions:

```typescript
suggestions: [
  { id: "1", label: "How to search", query: "How do I search for cars?" },
  { id: "2", label: "Sell my car", query: "How do I sell my car?" }
]
```

### Contextual Responses
The assistant adapts responses based on:
- Current page location
- User authentication status
- User role (user/admin)
- Previous interactions
