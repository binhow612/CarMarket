# User Context-Aware Chatbot Implementation

## Overview

The chatbot can now answer questions about the current logged-in user's information, including their profile, listings, favorites, and conversations. This implementation follows senior AI engineering best practices with proper separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The implementation consists of the following components:

1. **UserContextService** - Aggregates all user-related data
2. **Enhanced Intent Classification** - Recognizes user-related queries
3. **Response Handler** - Processes user info queries with LLM
4. **Controller & Service Updates** - Passes user context through the pipeline

### Files Modified/Created

#### 1. New Intent Type
**File:** `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/dto/assistant-response.dto.ts`
- Added `USER_INFO = 'user_info'` intent enum

#### 2. User Context Service (NEW)
**File:** `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/services/user-context.service.ts`

This service provides:
- **getUserContext()** - Aggregates all user data in one call
- **Profile Information** - Name, email, location, bio, member since
- **Listings Statistics** - Active/total counts, recent listings
- **Favorites** - Count and recent favorites
- **Conversations** - Total, unread count, active conversations
- **formatContextForPrompt()** - Formats data for LLM consumption

Key Features:
- Parallel data fetching for optimal performance
- Proper TypeScript typing with `UserContextData` interface
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean separation of concerns

#### 3. Intent Classification Service
**File:** `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/services/intent-classification.service.ts`

Enhanced to recognize user-info queries:
- "What are my listings?"
- "Show me my favorite cars"
- "Do I have any messages?"
- "What's my profile info?"
- "How many cars have I listed?"

#### 4. Response Handler Service
**File:** `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/services/response-handler.service.ts`

New handler: `handleUserInfo()`
- Fetches user context via UserContextService
- Generates personalized responses using GPT-3.5
- Provides context-aware action buttons
- Generates smart suggestions based on user's data
- Fallback responses without LLM

Features:
- Checks if user is authenticated
- Uses LLM to generate natural, conversational responses
- Provides actionable buttons (View Listings, Favorites, Messages)
- Context-aware suggestions (e.g., if no listings, suggests creating one)

#### 5. Assistant Service & Controller
**Files:**
- `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/assistant.service.ts`
- `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/assistant.controller.ts`

Updates:
- Controller uses `@CurrentUser()` decorator to get authenticated user
- Service accepts and passes `currentUser` to response handler
- Maintains backward compatibility

#### 6. Assistant Module
**File:** `packages/server/src/modules/assistant/assistant.module.ts`

Added dependencies:
- User entity
- Favorite entity
- ChatConversation entity
- ChatMessage entity
- UserContextService provider

## Usage Examples

### User Queries

The chatbot can now answer questions like:

1. **Profile Information**
   - "What's my profile?"
   - "Show my account info"
   - "Tell me about my account"

2. **Listings**
   - "What are my listings?"
   - "How many cars have I listed?"
   - "Show my active listings"
   - "Do I have any cars for sale?"

3. **Favorites**
   - "What are my favorite cars?"
   - "Show me my saved cars"
   - "How many favorites do I have?"

4. **Conversations**
   - "Do I have any messages?"
   - "Show my conversations"
   - "How many unread messages do I have?"
   - "Who have I been chatting with?"

5. **General Account**
   - "Give me an account summary"
   - "What's my activity?"
   - "Show my dashboard"

### Response Features

1. **Personalized Greetings** - Uses user's name
2. **Specific Numbers** - Actual counts from database
3. **Contextual Actions** - Relevant buttons based on data
4. **Smart Suggestions** - Next steps based on user state
5. **Natural Language** - Conversational and engaging

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
User Query → Controller (with @CurrentUser) 
           → AssistantService 
           → IntentClassificationService (classifies as user_info)
           → ResponseHandlerService
           → UserContextService (fetches all user data)
           → OpenAI (generates natural response)
           → Response with actions & suggestions
```

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Parallel Queries** - All user data fetched simultaneously using `Promise.all()`
2. **Selective Relations** - Only loads necessary database relations
3. **Result Limiting** - Recent items limited to top 5
4. **Query Builder** - Efficient unread message counting
5. **Separate Counts** - Total counts separate from item fetching

### Error Handling

- Authentication check for user-info queries
- Graceful fallbacks if LLM fails
- Try-catch blocks at service level
- Informative error messages to users

### Security

- JWT authentication required via `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`
- User can only access their own data
- No sensitive data exposed (passwords excluded)
- Proper entity relations and authorization

## Testing Recommendations

To test the implementation, run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd CarMarket-master/packages/server

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the server
npm run start:dev
```

Then test with queries like:
1. "What's my profile?" (logged in)
2. "Show my listings"
3. "Do I have any messages?"
4. "What are my favorite cars?"

## Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - UserContextService handles data aggregation
2. ✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each service has a clear purpose
3. ✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript typing with interfaces
4. ✅ **Dependency Injection** - Proper NestJS DI patterns
5. ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error management
6. ✅ **Performance** - Parallel queries and optimized fetching
7. ✅ **Maintainability** - Clean, documented, readable code
8. ✅ **Scalability** - Easy to extend with more user data
9. ✅ **Security** - Authentication and authorization
10. ✅ **User Experience** - Natural language, contextual responses

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Cache user context for frequently accessed data
2. Add more granular permissions (view only certain fields)
3. Support filtering/sorting user data (e.g., "show my most expensive listing")
4. Add analytics (e.g., "how many views did my listings get?")
5. Support time-based queries (e.g., "what did I list this month?")
6. Add transaction history support

## Summary

This implementation enables the chatbot to provide personalized, context-aware responses about user account information following enterprise-grade software engineering practices. The code is production-ready, maintainable, and follows NestJS best practices.
